# This are powershell scripts I used for converting into executables.
# How to use:
  - First set execution policy to RemoteRigned by typing this into administrator powershell:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  - Then you can run it with powershell
    # After installation change execution policy back to restricted if you want
      - Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
# Have fun!
