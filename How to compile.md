# To compile you need VS 2022 or your compiler of choice
# Compiling in VS 2022:
 - To compile in VS 2022 you select "windows desktop application" and paste the code from the main branch from folder =>
 - "C++ GUI Installers" and build it.
# Compiling with g++ compiler or compiler of your choice.
 - On command line you need to manually install c++ compiler and compile it yourself.
 - With g++ you use something like this: g++ DarioInstallsOffice.cpp -o DarioInstallsOffice.exe -lgdi32 -luser32 -lshell32 -lwininet -mwindows
 - You need to install GCC to compile it this way.

 I recomend using g++ which is part of GCC.
 # Have fun!
