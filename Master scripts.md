# Python user input-based scripts
Master scripts are python scripts which allow user to chose which version of office they want to install.
The executables are same as python scripts but can be used without python installed.
# Installation with python:
  - Download python script
  - Just double click on it
  - And input correct version
# Installation without python
  - Download the executable
  - Just double click on it
  - And input correct version
# Windows will flag the executables so I recomend installing with python.
